  "text": "Motivation Letter\nRespected Sir/Madam,\nMy name is Shashank Bhati and I am from India. I am a master student in the field of Business\nAnalytics at TU Freiberg. I got to know about this EURECA-PRO Summer School 2022 on Innovation\nand Entrepreneurship via EUREKA-Pro. In addition to this motivation letter, I have also prepared a\nvideo which I have also uploaded. Its also available online via this link\nhttps://app.animaker.com/video/6DFDYS6813HUJUCC\nI have been actively involved in university activities since the beginning of my master's degree. In the\nfreshman week I got to know my student council and learned more about their work. I found it very\ninteresting how this small group supported the students and organized attractive events for us.\nThat's why I decided to stand for the student council elections in May 2022. I also help the newly\narriving students with their arrival and their studies as I volunteer as a mentor in the Buddy Program\nat the International University Centre. I was elected chair of the student group by EURECA-PRO.\nEURECA-PRO is an alliance of 7 universities that have come together to enable students and\nemployees to study, teach and research in the field of responsible consumption and production. A\nlong-term goal of the project is to realize a common, virtual and integrated European campus by\n2040. I look forward to connecting with students from all over Europe and applying my leadership\nskills as I am not only the representative of the students but I also want to promote the connection\nbetween students from all over Europe.\nI completed my bachelor's degree in Computer Application at Jamia Hamdard University in 2020.\nDuring my bachelor's degree, I also did a course \"Data Science with Python\". I have good\nprogramming knowledge and analytical skills.\nDuring my bachelor's degree, I developed an interest in econometric models and the use of statistics\nto help a business. Due to my knowledge of data science and my interest in economics, I chose the\nMaster in Business Analytics. I did well in my bachelor's degree (1.65 GPA) and successfully\ncompleted my studies in November 2020. I did my bachelor thesis on the subject of fingerprint\nsensors. For the project I used an optical fingerprint sensor and worked with the Arduino IDE\nsoftware.\nNot only that I have experience of working as a Model for photoshoots and video shoots for\nVolkswagon, Dresden.\nOverall I consider myself a strong applicant for the Summer School 2022 on Innovation and\nEntrepreneurship with my social commitments, creativity and academics records.\nThanking You\nShashank Bhati\nshashankbhati@outlook.com\n+49 15739344066",
