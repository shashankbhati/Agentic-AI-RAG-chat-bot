This is a GenAI-powered document search assistant (RAG system) designed to retrieve and answer questions from domain-specific PDF document.
The pipeline processes raw PDFs, extracts structured text and metadata using Python and pdfplumber, generates embeddings with Transformer-based sentence embedding models, and stores them in a Qdrant vector database for fast similarity search. I developed a FastAPI backend that exposes search endpoints and performs retrieval-augmented querying over the stored embeddings. The system is containerized with Docker for reproducible deployment and local development.
